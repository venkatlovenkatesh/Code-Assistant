# Code Assistant using ollama

Ollama is an open source tool that allows you to run large language models, which are a type of artificial intelligence, directly on your own computer. This provides you with an AI powered coding assistant that can help you write and understand code without needing to send your code to external servers on the internet. Using Ollama keeps your code private and secure on your local machine. To get started with Ollama, you first install a special extension called Continue in either the Visual Studio Code or JetBrains software that you use for writing code. You then configure Continue to use one of the Ollama models, such as the Codestral 22B model. After that, you can open the Continue sidebar in your code editor and chat with the AI assistant, or select some code and get the AI's help on that specific code snippet. Ollama provides a library of different AI models that are pre-trained, including one called CodeLlama that is specialized for programming tasks. You can also take these models and fine-tune them yourself using your own company's code, then share that customized model with your whole team through the Ollama library. This allows you to integrate a powerful, open source, and privacy-focused AI coding assistant directly into your regular code writing workflow.
